    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
    These are HTML tags that provide meaning to the mark up. 
    These include tags like main, section, article, nav, header, and footer. These aid
    in accessibility, make your code easier for another developer or a later you to
    understand your code, and increase Search Engine Optimization.

    2. What is HTML used for? 
    HTML is one of three front end web technologies and is used to provide the structure 
    or raw materials for the web page. It is a mark up language not a programming one.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
    An attribute is an extra piece of information either required or added for more info
    to a particular HTML element. It is added inside the opening tag. An example would be
    the href attribute in a link tag <a href="#home">Home</a>

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
    An h1 tag is a heading tag, the most important of the six types (h1...h6)and is
    used to indicate the most important heading on a page. There should only be one
    h1 on each page to indicate the main idea of the page, this helps with SEO.

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
    The anchor tag <a> requires a href attribute for a link and the <img> tag requires a src 
    attribute for an image.

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
    The head of our HTML document contains meta data about the page. It contains a title
    which appears in the webpage tab and may contain information about language, viewport 
    size, character set, and link tags to add external CSS style sheets.

    7. What is an id? 
    An id is an attribute that provides a unique identifier used for styling or same page 
    navigation. It is used as a CSS selector using the syntax #id-name.

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
    You can add an id to any element's opening tag. 
    An example would be <h1 id="title">My Page</h1>

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
    Because it serves as a unique identifier, there should only be one of each name on a page.

    10. What is a class? 
    A class serves as identifier of one or more elements on a page. It is added as an
    optional attribute to the opening tag of an element. 

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
    You may add the class attribute to any opening element's tag.
    An example would be <section class="recipe"></section>

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
    You can use the same class as many times as you would like to.
    This allows common styling to be shared across multiple types of elements.

    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
    To get the link to open in a new tab, you can add the attribute target="_blank"
    to the inside of the a tag. An example would be 
    <a href="https://lambdaschool.com" target="_blank">lambdaschool.com</a>

    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for? 
    The alt attribute allows for a description of the image. This is useful for 
    accessibility for screen readers or for identification if the image doesn't load.

    15. How do I reference an id?
    To reference an id, you use #id-name. 

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
    A section is an example of a semantic HTML tag instead of just a presentational
    one. A section indicates content grouped with meaning on the page. A div allows
    content to be grouped for styling purposes. You might use a section to indicate
    each new recipe on your cooking website but use a div to group the entire content 
    of the page or group tags within the section to place in columns.

    17. What is CSS used for? 
    CSS is Cascading Style Sheets and it is used for layout and design on a page. 

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
    To select an element, we just use the element name when creating CSS rules. 
    To select an h2, we would use the syntax:
    h2 {
        property:value
    }

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
    A class and id are two different identifiers/types of CSS selectors. You would use an id, 
    when you want to apply a unique style to one particular item on a page. Classes allow
    different elements to be styled with the same style rules. For example, you may want all
    paragraphs and a links to have the same font-family and color.

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
    In CSS we select classes using the syntax .class-name.

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
    We would select the element with p.human

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
    A parent child selector is something like the following:
    ul li {

    }
    This allows us to select for all the list items that are children of the unorderer
    list.

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
    The selector for all links within a div with the class of sidebar would be
    div.sidebar a{

    }

    24. What is a pseudo selector?
    A pseudo selector allows us to select for a specific state of an element.
    This can allow us to apply style to a link element on a mouse hover.
    Ex. a:hover
    
    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?
    To change the spacing between lines, we can use the line-height property. It 
    is set with a ratio value which is related to the font size.

    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
    To change the spacing between letters, we can use the letter-spacing property. 
    We can give this a value in px.

    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
    We can change the capitalization with CSS using the text-transform property. 
    Valid values include uppercase, lowercase, and capitalize.

    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
    I can use the border property and give it all three values in the same rule.
    div {
        border: 1px dotted #000000;
    }
    
    29. How do I select everything on the page? 
    I can select everything on a page with the universal selector. 
    * {

    }

    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?
    Comments in CSS are between /* This is a comment */

    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line? 
    I can find out the folder or directory by using the command pwd, which will give
    me my working directory.

    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?
    I can see the files and folders in my current folder by using the ls command.

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this?
    I can remove a file at command line by using rm filename.ext
    This is dangerous because there is no "are you sure?" warning, and it is not retrievable
    from your trash.

    34. Why should I use version control? 
    Version control allows us to take snapshots during development over time. If need be
    I can revert to an earlier version, without having to save this earlier version as
    a separate file with a different filename. It is also useful to allow developers to work
    on the same piece of software simultaneously. Each one can work on their own forked
    branch which can be merged back to the master later. It allows a member of the team
    to try something new on a side branch without braking a working application.

    35. How often should I commit to github?
    I should commit often to track my progress on each piece of a project.

    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
    If I am using a branch I created in my cloned repository, the first time I push to
    github I should use: git push -u origin gina-russell

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
    My workflow at Lambda:
    On GitHub
    Step 1: Fork a repository to my github account, and verify with the title.
    Step 2: Add my TL as a collaborator on my project's repository using the Settings
    and Manage Access options.
    Step 3: Copy the link from the Code button to Clone the repository

    On my computer
    Step 4: Navigate to the directory where I want to clone my project 
    using the CLI cd command
    Step 5: Use the command git clone repository_url at the terminal prompt, using
    the copied url for the repository_url
    Step 6: Create a branch from the master from my repository using the command
    git checkout -b "gina-russell"
    Step 7: Verify my branch using the command git branch
    Step 8: Work on my project by creating files or folders at command line using the
    touch filename.ext command or the mkdir foldername command. 
    Step 9: Use git status often to check my progress.
    Step 10: Use git add . to start tracking all files and folders created or to add the
    information to the tracked version after making changes on a next step.
    Step 11: Use git commit -m "insert a meaningful message about this saved snapshot" to 
    save a snapshot version of the project. These commit stages are what can be used
    to revert to an earlier stage if need be.
    Step 12: Use git push to push the changes back to the github cloud storage using
    the command git push -u origin gina-russell with the first push and then just git push 
    for subsequent changes.
    Step 13: Repeat Steps 8-12 until project is complete.

    On GitHub
    Step 14: Create a Pull Request, making sure the comparison for the pull is with
    my forked master, not The Lambda School original repository (I must change this 
    before I submit because the original Lambda School version will appear as the default choice.)
    Step 15: Add my TL as the Reviewer for the request.
    Step 16: I'm done, My TL will review the code and merge the request after the assignment is reviewed.


Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
